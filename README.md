# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the power of Jupyter Notebooks, Python, and APIs by creating a personalized travel itinerary based on user preferences. Our World Weather Analysis pulls data from the Open Weather Map API (openweathermap.org/api) and then leverages the vast Google Maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps) to identify travel locations around the globe. The folder "Weather_Database" contains a notebook that creates a list of random GPS coordinates, queries Google's API to find the closest city to each of those points, and builds a database of global cities and their weather data. Our next folder, "Vacation_Search," gathers user temperature preferences to create a map of hotels in cities with matching weather conditions. Finally, "Vacation_Itinerary" again queries Google's Directions API to build a map with driving directions between some selected destinations. 

Happy Travels!
